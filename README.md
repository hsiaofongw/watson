## Abstract 

Nowadays it's more easy and cheap, to build, to maintain, and to publish a webSite to the Internet, since doing this makes a lot of fun, and people who doing this can learning so much knowledge about computer science and network from this, there are already a huge number of websites people have already built and published on the Internet. We propose a perspective to model and monitor arbitary website by simply treating a website as an abstract Object just like treating a project like a Object (see POM). There's nothing new but new perspective in this article.
